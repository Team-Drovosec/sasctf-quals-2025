Hi! This is Bob from incident response.

Reaching to you regarding that ransomware attack we've had on our side-hosted server running "Windows Server 2019 Standard (17763.3650)". I was really surprised to find out MS Teams on the application list. Like, this a server, why would you need a corporate chat there?

That looks kinda SUS, aren't you thinking so? That being said, attaching some related artifacts. Check asap.

Best regards, Bob Guzini, Neck of IR Department.
