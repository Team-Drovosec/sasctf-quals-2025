I miss those times when discord bots had an ability to play music... With a single button press you can change speed, pitch, bass... I like some tracks to bee speedy, some to be slow, some to bang from the back.

I was seeking for a solution for so long, and luckily found one! Or so I thought... Yesterday my friend from a local secret service called me and said I should change my passwords. How could he know? He refused to answer :(
