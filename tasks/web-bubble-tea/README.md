## Description
An old duke is having a walkout near London's Tower. He sees a dog lying by the path.

\- I do how how. - it answers.

## Solution
This is a post sharing service with the ability to ask an admin to comment on your post. BB-codes are supported for extensive formatting. Flag is being stored inside of the private post made by an admin.

Well... we've forgot to put the strict checks on which attributes can be set for `[img]` bb-code, thus solution became very straightforward - just `[img onerror=...]` your way into the admin's secret post.
As for the intended vulnerability and solution - it's up to you to find it, maybe it will get another life in a different form some day :)
